# syncronator
For consumers who want both scalability and the security of owning and controlling their own data, but also want a storage system that is simple to setup and use, Syncronator is designed as a solution to this problem. Currently, the enterprise-level storage systems offer scalability and security, but require some advanced level of technical skills as they have more complicated architectures. On the other hand, consumer-grade storage systems are relatively simple to set up and user-friendly but do not offer the scalability or security of the distributed file systems. Syncronator is a distributed file system that seeks to bridge this gap between the consumer and enterprise platforms.  Further, it should be able to run on all of the three major operating systems, Windows, Linux and Mac, consistent with our goal of making it easy to use. In bridging this gap, Syncronator will offer consumers the following three main features of a distributed file system:  
* Single View Access to files - Provide a single view of all of the consumer’s files, regardless of where they are located.
* Global Access to files - Provide remote access to a consumer’s files from anywhere in the world since consumers today are more mobile than ever before.
* User Hardware- Provide for consumer control of his or her files by having the files stored on the consumer’s hardware.

Further, since Syncronator is geared towards the consumer without advanced computer knowledge or technical skills, we added more consumer friendly and expected features. They include: 
* Friendly UI - The UI is very intuitive. Consumers can easily switch to the system from their generic file system applications.
* Taskbar Support - The application runs in the taskbar even after the window is closed.
* Supporting features/Drag and drop - The supporting features are ones that consumers are already familiar with, such as “drag and drop” files into the UI.
